Project "Acuity"/"Defpotec"

This GIT repo is used by the Microsoft C+AI Cloud Design Studio ("CDS") Prototyping team ("Azure Prototyping").

Open Issue: We are still investigating if we can deliver an "easy to code" React.JS prototype without taking dependencies like Node.js, etc.

The folder structure outlined here is described as follows:

/node/ - for "Node.js" spcecific features and instances needed by this team.
/node/template/ - "node.js" specific template of the CDS 
/node/[uxr-build name-date]/ - for specific builds/deployments

/standalone/ - root folder for the "standalone" prototype template & subsequent deployments/builds
/standalone/template/ - baseline project, to be copied for deployments/buiilds
/standalong/[uxr-build name-date]/ - for specific builds/deployments
