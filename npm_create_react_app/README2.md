## Created facebook's "Create React App" getting started package. 

#### PC instructions
Windows command prompt cheat sheet: http://simplyadvanced.net/blog/cheat-sheet-for-windows-command-prompt/

Be sure node is downloaded globally. In order to open terminal it is easiest to have this project opened as a folder opposed to as a website. Right click any root level item (such as one of the readme's) and select "Open Command Developer Prompt". 


* To install packages for this folder and run for the first time: 
```
npm i
npm start
```

*Once packages installed and you just want to run node:
```
npm start
```

* To create a new react app (you won't be using this command as this project already exists):
```
Create-react-app  appname
```
